Activity 3: Apply more filters in SQL
- Filter for login attempts made after a certain date
- Filter for login attempts made in a certain date range
- Filter for login attempts made at a certain time
- Filter for login attempts by ID

Activity 4: Filter with AND, OR, and NOT (Screenshots from lab used to complete this project)

- Filter for login attempts on specific dates
- Filter for login attempts from specific locations
- Filter for information on employees in specific departments
