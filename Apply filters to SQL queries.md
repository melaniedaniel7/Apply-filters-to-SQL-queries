Scenario:
You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. 
You recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.
Your task is to examine the organizationâ€™s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. 
Youâ€™ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.

### Project description
Describe what you accomplish through SQL.
In the Project description section, give a general overview of the scenario and what you accomplish through SQL. Write two to four sentences.


### Retrieve after hours failed login attempts
I recently discovered a potential security incident that occurred after business hours. 
To investigate this, I needed to query the `log_in_attempts` table and review after hours login activity. 

I used the greater than operator `>`, the equals `=` operator and the `AND` operator in SQL to create a query that identified all failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00.

In the image below I used the `SELECT *` query to select all columns in the database. 
I then used the `FROM` query to filter data from the `log_in_attempts` table.
Finally, I used the `WHERE` filter to identify failed login attempts recorded afterhours in the `login_time` column.

To review the `login_time` column for afterhours only, the greater than `>` operator is used followed by the time `18:00`. The greater than operator specifies that I am only interested in data after the specified time period.

The `AND` operator is used becuase I have two conditions that I want met simultaneously.

To identify failed login attempts I used the fact that MySQL utilizes Boolean data. This means that the Boolean value `1` represents `TRUE` and the Boolean value `0` represents `FALSE`. These can be used interchangeably. In the image below I specified the condition of failed login attempts using `success = FALSE` followed by a semiclon `;` to signify the end of the query. The equals `=` operator indicates that the login attempt must be unsuccessful.

ðŸ’¡ Boolean values are not placed in single quotes because they are not string data, they are Boolean data.

The image below highlightes the operators used in green, Boolean data in pink, and the correlation between login time and failed login attempts in blue.

### Retrieve login attempts on specific dates
A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. To investigate this event, you want to review all login attempts which occurred on this day and the day before. 
Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all login attempts that occurred on 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. 
(The date of the login attempt is found in the login_date column.)
Describe your query and how it works.



### Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico
Thereâ€™s been suspicious activity with login attempts, but the team has determined that this activity didn't originate in Mexico. 
Now, you need to investigate login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. 
Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. 
(When referring to Mexico, the country column contains values of both MEX and MEXICO, and you need to use the LIKE keyword with % to make sure your query reflects this.)
Describe your query and how it works.



### Retrieve employees in Marketing
Your team wants to perform security updates on specific employee machines in the Marketing department. 
Youâ€™re responsible for getting information on these employee machines and will need to query the employees table. 
Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all employees in the Marketing department for all offices in the East building.
(The department of the employee is found in the department column, which contains values that include Marketing. 
The office is found in the office column. Some examples of values in this column are East-170, East-320, and North-434. 
Youâ€™ll need to use the LIKE keyword with % to filter for the East building.)
Describe your query and how it works.



### Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales
Your team now needs to perform a different security update on machines for employees in the Sales and Finance departments. 
Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all employees in the Sales or Finance departments. 
(The department of the employee is found in the department column, which contains values that include Sales and Finance.)
Describe your query and how it works.



### Retrieve all employees not in IT
Your team needs to make one more update to employee machines. 
The employees who are in the Information Technology department already had this update, but employees in all other departments need it. 
Use filters in SQL to create a query which identifies all employees not in the IT department. 
(The department of the employee is found in the department column, which contains values that include Information Technology.)
Describe your query and how it works.



### Summary
In the Summary section, provide a short summary of the previous tasks and connect them to the scenario. Write approximately two to four sentences.
